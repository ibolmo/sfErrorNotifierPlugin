= sfErrorNotifierPlugin plugin =

The `sfErrorNotifierPlugin` sends automatically email notifications when application errors (exceptions) occur and are not caught.

Its easy configuration allows you to set which environments to enable for the notifications.

The details about the thrown exceptions and other useful parameteers are sent via email.

NEW! It is also possible to trigger notifications explicitly by using this line from anywhere in your code (the email will be sent only from the environments enabled for the notifications):

    {{{
      sfErrorNotifier::alert('Message To Send With The Alert')   
    }}}

== Installation ==

  * Install the plugin
  
    {{{
      symfony plugin:install sfErrorNotifierPlugin
    }}}

  * In the file /plugins/sfErrorNotifierPlugin/config/app.yml,  set the email address(es) to deliver the notifications to, for the environments you want to enable (tipically only 'prod').
You can comma-separate multiple recipients.

    {{{
      prod:
        sfErrorNotifier:
          emailTo:      errors@mysite.com
    }}}

In this configuration file, you can also set the format of the email (html or txt) and, optionally, the From: field for the email.

  * Clear the cache

    {{{
      symfony cc
    }}}

  * Some users have mentioned they needed to override the default error page in order to get this plugin to work. You shouldn't need that, but just in case the plugin doesn't work, try to do it. The way to set a custom error page is explained in the Symfony books.

  * You're done.
